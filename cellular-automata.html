			<p>One of the YouTube channels I subscribe to, a Swedish JavaScript developer by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q">Mattias Petter Johansson</a>, created this Cellular Automaton in one of his videos. I thought it was pretty cool and added a little bit to it. In the video, they hardcode one single rule and it's a set color. What I decided to add was a way to input any of the 256 rule numbers and have it generate that pattern. I also added a function to change the RGB value for every active-state cell, incrementing by one with each new active cell.</p>
			<p>Basically what's going on is each cell has one of two states: active or inactive, active being the colored cell and inactive being white. Each cell's state is determined by the states of the 3 cells above it: immediately above, above to the left, and above to the right. The first inital row is generated randomly so you have a general pattern but it's still a random pattern each time you'd run the same rule. So you have 2 possibilites for each cell, 8 possibilities for each rule, making 256 rules. Thankfully 1 and 0 equte to True and False in JavaScript or typing in all 256 rules would have taken much longer than it already did.</p>

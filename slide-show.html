			<p>This is a replication of a small side project I was asked to work on at my current role at Amazon. The idea is was to create a ticker at the bottom, displaying the weather and some other data while displaying a slideshow above it of recent events, newsletters, or whatever you would want.</p>
			<p>The real life project only uses HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript to pull weather data from a public API and displays images dynamically, reading from a local directory with some jQuery and JS filtering tricks. So to change the images displayed, you only need to replace the files in the directory - no need to alter any code.</p>
			<p>This project essentially does the exact same thing. The difference is this one is made with NodeJS, for a couple reasons. I haven't used Heroku yet, so this was a learning experience with that. I also don't have any actual NodeJS projects hosted yet. The Angular Metrics app is a MEAN stack app, but I only hosted the code on GitHub so it's just a static page with no server-side functionality. Node's FileSystem also made the slideshow MUCH easier to create than trying to use client-side JavaScript.</p>
			<p>The weather ticker is in there, but Heroku wasn't happy about trying to connect with HTTP, so I just hard coded some texted.</p>
